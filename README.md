# Trigonometric-Calculator-

This is a type of calculator where we can find out all the trigonometric values of any value of angles, in any degrees! ðŸ˜‰ I used mostly the math library in order to fetch the values associated with the trigonometric methods, and it will show all the methods when we click on any corresponding method button.

This will actually help the students to get the values of any methods, in degrees, easily! But apparently, for the timebeimg, the value is set in degrees only, not in radians, which I think is the majority for all the students! 

Hope you liked the project, and feel free to use it! :)

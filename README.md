# Trigonometric-Calculator

This is a type of calculator where we can find out all the trigonometric values of any value of angles, in any degree! ðŸ˜‰ I used mostly the inbuilt "math" library in Python to fetch the values associated with the trigonometric methods, and it will show all the methods when we click on any corresponding method button.

This will help the students to get the values of any methods, in degrees, easily! But, for the time being, the value is set in degrees only, not in radians, which I think is the majority for all the students! 

Hope you liked the project, and feel free to use it! :)
